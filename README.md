# jQuery Move Divs

A simple interactive project using **HTML, CSS, jQuery**, and **DOM manipulation**.  
Two boxes contain multiple colored child boxes.  
Buttons allow you to move the child boxes from left → right and right → left.

---

##  How It Works

- The first black box contains 3 colored child boxes.
- The second black box contains 2 colored child boxes.
- When you click **"Move to right"**, the last child of the left box moves to the right.
- When you click **"Move to left"**, the last child of the right box moves back to the left.
- If there are no more boxes to move, an alert is shown.
